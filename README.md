# gobyte

`gobyte` is a command-line tool that enables fast and secure file transfers between devices on the same local network. It uses a custom file transfer protocol over TLS-encrypted TCP connections with a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) security mechanism.

## How It Works

### Connection

`gobyte` uses `trust-on-first-use` over TLS/TCP similar to how SSH works. When establishing a connection, both peers must trust each other to proceed.

### Protocol

Each connection must start with the sender sending a `RequestHeader` which is encoded as `0x1F<version>0x1F<number of files>0x1F<total bytes>0x1F0x1D`.

The receiver can either send an ok or not ok `ResponseHeader`: `0x1F0x00x1F0x1D` or `0x1F0x1A0x1F0x1D` respectively. Sending a not ok response will immediately terminate the connection. 

After sending an ok `ResponseHeader`, the sender can start sending files.

When sending a file, the sender must send a `FileHeader` which is encoded as `0x1F<size>0x1F<name>0x1F<relative-path>0x1F0x1D`, before sending the actual file bytes.

An entire file will look like `0x1F110x1Fhello_world.txt0x1F./0x1F0x1Dhello world0x1D`. The sender can send multiple files unless it explicitly sends `0x1F0x1E0x1F0x1D` which is an `EndHeader` - then the receiver will immediately terminate the connection.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/Dyastin-0/gobyte@latest
```

## Usage

Start as a receiver:
```bash
gobyte receive
```

Start as a sender:
```bash
gobyte send
```
